    <h1>KA-CHOW!</h1>
    <p>[Inhaling and exhaling deeply]

[male] Okay. Here we go. Focus.

Speed. I am speed.

[cars whizzing past]

One winner, 42 losers.

I eat losers for breakfast.

[car accelerating]

Breakfast.

Wait, maybe I

should have had breakfast.

A little breck-y could be good for me.

No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

[cars whizzing]

I'm faster than fast.

Quicker than quick.

I am lightning!

[pounding on door]

[male] Hey, Lightning! You ready?

[Sheryl Crow:
Real Gone]

Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.

[engine revving]

[Engine revs]

[Crowd cheers]

Ka-chow!</p>
